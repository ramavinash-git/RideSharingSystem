# RideSharingSystem
The Ride Sharing System is a console-based Java application that simulates a platform similar to Ola/Uber. It allows users to book rides by entering details like driver name, vehicle number, distance, and ride type. The system uses object-oriented principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and exception handling to provide a structured design.
